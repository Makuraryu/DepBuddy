Large Language Model Agent Enhanced Based on Psychoanalytic Theory

# Philosophy
Traditional large language models are almost entirely built on pure mathematical prediction, but this does not encompass everything a "neurosis" is meant to do. In a series of previous works, researchers have offered a "metaphorical" analogy related to linguistic structures to understand large language models, and have used psychiatric mechanisms to explain the phenomenon of hallucinations in these models. Based on such understanding, this project takes the psychoanalytic constitution of the subject as its theoretical basis, attempting to construct an agent dominated by the mechanisms of depression and transference, and breaking down its operation into a series of "self-aware" modes of thinking.
